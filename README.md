# Emotion Detection Project

This project is an AI-based web application developed as the final project for the IBM Coursera course. The application leverages Watson NLP to detect emotions in text. Built with Flask, it provides a web interface for users to input text and receive emotion analysis.

## Project Description

The Emotion Detection Project is designed to interpret and analyze emotions from textual input. Using Watson Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, the application can identify and classify various emotions expressed in the text. This project showcases the integration of advanced NLP techniques with a user-friendly web interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python used to develop the web interface and deploy the application.
- **Watson NLP**: IBM's Natural Language Processing technology utilized for emotion detection and text analysis.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end technologies used to create a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Emotion Analysis**: Input text is processed to detect emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and more.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can easily input text and view the analyzed emotions through a simple web interface.


## Deployment

The application is deployed using Flask, making it accessible as a web service. Users can interact with the application by accessing the web interface, inputting text, and receiving real-time emotion analysis results.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning models with web development to create practical AI applications. It highlights the use of Flask for deployment and the power of Watson NLP for understanding human emotions through text.
